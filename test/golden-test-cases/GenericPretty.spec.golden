%description
GenericPretty is a Haskell library that supports automatic derivation of pretty
printing functions on user defined data types.

The form of generics used is based on that introduced in the paper: Magalhaes,
Dijkstra, Jeuring, and Loh, A Generic Deriving Mechanism for Haskell, 3'rd ACM
Symposium on Haskell, pp. 37-48, September 2010,
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1863523.1863529>. Changes from the original paper in
the GHC implementation are described here:
<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC.Generics#Changes_from_the_paper>.

This package requires the use of the new GHC.Generics features
<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/GHC.Generics>, present from GHC 7.2.
Use of these features is indicated by the DeriveGeneric pragma or the flag
-XDeriveGeneric.

Pretty printing produces values of type Text.PrettyPrint.Doc, using the
Text.PrettyPrint library
<http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/pretty-1.1.1.0/Text-PrettyPrint.html>.

The output provided is a pretty printed version of that provided by
Prelude.show. That is, rendering the document provided by this pretty printer
yields an output identical to that of Prelude.show, except for extra
whitespace.

For information about the functions exported by the package please see the API
linked further down this page. For examples of usage, both basic and more
complex see the README file and the haskell source code files in the TestSuite
folder, both included in the package. Finally for installation instructions
also see the README file or this page:
<http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Cabal/How_to_install_a_Cabal_package>.
