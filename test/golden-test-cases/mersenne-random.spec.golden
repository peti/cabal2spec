%description
The Mersenne twister is a pseudorandom number generator developed by Makoto
Matsumoto and Takuji Nishimura that is based on a matrix linear recurrence over
a finite binary field. It provides for fast generation of very high quality
pseudorandom numbers

This library uses SFMT, the SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister, a variant of
Mersenne Twister that is much faster than the original. It is designed to be
fast when it runs on 128-bit SIMD. It can be compiled with either SSE2 and
PowerPC AltiVec support, to take advantage of these instructions.

> cabal install -fuse_sse2

On an x86 system, for performance win.

By default the period of the function is 2^19937-1, however, you can compile in
other defaults. Note that this algorithm on its own is not cryptographically
secure.

For more information about the algorithm and implementation, see the SFMT
homepage,
