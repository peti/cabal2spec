%description
We can characterise the state of a concurrent computation by considering the
ordering of dependent events. This is a partial order: independent events can
be performed in any order without affecting the result. DPOR is a technique for
computing these partial orders at run-time, and only testing one total order
for each partial order. This cuts down the amount of work to be done
significantly. In particular, this package implemented bounded partial-order
reduction, which is a further optimisation. Only schedules within some *bound*
are considered.

* DPOR with no schedule bounding is __complete__, it /will/ find all distinct
executions!

* DPOR with schedule bounding is __incomplete__, it will only find all distinct
executions /within the bound/!

__Caution:__ The fundamental assumption behind DPOR is that the *only* source
of nondeterminism in your program is the scheduler. Or, to put it another way,
if you execute the same program with the same schedule twice, you get the same
result. If you are using this library in combination with something which
performs I/O, be *very* certain that this is the case!

See the <https://github.com/barrucadu/dejafu README> for more details.

For details on the algorithm, albeit presented in a very imperative way, see
