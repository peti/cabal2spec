%description
Vty is terminal GUI library in the niche of ncurses. It is intended to be easy
to use, have no confusing corner cases, and good support for common terminal
types.

See the 'vty-examples' package as well as the program
'test/interactive_terminal_test.hs' included in the 'vty' package for examples
on how to use the library.

Import the "Graphics.Vty" convenience module to get access to the core parts of
the library.
