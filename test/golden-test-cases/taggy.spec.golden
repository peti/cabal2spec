%description
/taggy/ is a simple package for parsing HTML (and should work with XML) written
on top of the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec attoparsec>
library, which makes it one of the most efficient (space and time consumption
wise) on hackage.

This is the root module of /taggy/. It reexports everything from the package.
See each module's docs for details about the functions and types involved in
/taggy/.

While we've been testing the parser on /many/ pages, it may still be a bit
rough around the edges. Let us know on
<http://github.com/alpmestan/taggy/issues github> if you have any problem.

If you like to look at your HTML through various optical instruments, feel free
to take a look at the companion <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/taggy-lens
taggy-lens> package we've put up together. It makes HTML parsing a piece of
cake.

If you want to parse a document as list of tags and go through it as some kind
of stream by just picking what you need, head to "Text.Taggy.Parser" and take a
look at 'Text.Taggy.Parser.taggyWith' and 'Text.Taggy.Parser.run'.

If you want to parse the document as a DOM tree and traverse it to find the
information you need, use 'Text.Taggy.DOM.parseDOM'. This is especially useful
when used in conjunction with <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/taggy-lens
taggy-lens>.

If you build some HTML manually or just transform some existing DOM tree and
want to turn it into a 'Data.Text.Lazy.Text' head to "Text.Taggy.Renderer" and
look at 'Text.Taggy.Renderer.render'.
