%description
QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties.

The programmer provides a specification of the program, in the form of
properties which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then tests that the
properties hold in a large number of randomly generated cases.

Specifications are expressed in Haskell, using combinators defined in the
QuickCheck library. QuickCheck provides combinators to define properties,
observe the distribution of test data, and define test data generators.

The <http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/QuickCheck/manual.html official
QuickCheck manual> explains how to write generators and properties; it is
out-of-date in some details but still full of useful advice.

A user of QuickCheck has written an unofficial, but detailed, tutorial which
you can find at
<https://begriffs.com/posts/2017-01-14-design-use-quickcheck.html>.
