%description
Various small helper functions for Lists, Maybes, Tuples, Functions.
Some of these functions are improved implementations of standard functions.
They have the same name as their standard counterparts. Others are equivalent
to functions from the 'base' package, but if you import them from this utility
package then you can write code that runs on older GHC versions or other
compilers like Hugs and JHC.

All modules are plain Haskell 98. The package depends exclusively on the 'base'
package and only that portions of 'base' that are simple to port. Thus you do
not risk a dependency avalanche by importing it. However, further splitting the
base package might invalidate this statement.

Alternative packages: 'Useful', 'MissingH'.
