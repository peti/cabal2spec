%description
'Data.Array.Accelerate' defines an embedded array language for computations for
high-performance computing in Haskell. Computations on multi-dimensional,
regular arrays are expressed in the form of parameterised collective
operations, such as maps, reductions, and permutations. These computations may
then be online compiled and executed on a range of architectures.

[/A simple example/]

As a simple example, consider the computation of a dot product of two vectors
of floating point numbers:

> dotp :: Acc (Vector Float) -> Acc (Vector Float) -> Acc (Scalar Float) > dotp
xs ys = fold (+) 0 (zipWith (*) xs ys)

Except for the type, this code is almost the same as the corresponding Haskell
code on lists of floats. The types indicate that the computation may be
online-compiled for performance - for example, using
'Data.Array.Accelerate.LLVM.PTX' it may be on-the-fly off-loaded to the GPU.

[/Additional components/]

The following supported add-ons are available as separate packages.
Install them from Hackage with 'cabal install <package>'

* 'accelerate-llvm-native': Backend supporting parallel execution on multicore
CPUs.

* 'accelerate-llvm-ptx': Backend supporting parallel execution on CUDA-capable
NVIDIA GPUs. Requires a GPU with compute capability 2.0 or greater.
See the following table for supported GPUs:
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#Supported_GPUs>

* 'accelerate-examples': Computational kernels and applications showcasing the
use of Accelerate as well as a regression test suite, supporting function and
performance testing.

* 'accelerate-io': Fast conversions between Accelerate arrays and other array
formats (including vector and repa).

* 'accelerate-fft': Discrete Fourier transforms, with FFI bindings to optimised
implementations.

* 'accelerate-bignum': Fixed-width large integer arithmetic.

* 'colour-accelerate': Colour representations in Accelerate (RGB, sRGB, HSV,
and HSL).

* 'gloss-accelerate': Generate gloss pictures from Accelerate.

* 'gloss-raster-accelerate': Parallel rendering of raster images and
animations.

* 'lens-accelerate': Lens operators for Accelerate types.

* 'linear-accelerate': Linear vector spaces in Accelerate.

* 'mwc-random-accelerate': Generate Accelerate arrays filled with high quality
pseudorandom numbers.

[/Examples and documentation/]

Haddock documentation is included in the package

The 'accelerate-examples' package demonstrates a range of computational kernels
and several complete applications, including:

* An implementation of the Canny edge detection algorithm

* An interactive Mandelbrot set generator

* A particle-based simulation of stable fluid flows

* An /n/-body simulation of gravitational attraction between solid particles

* An implementation of the PageRank algorithm

* A simple interactive ray tracer

* A particle based simulation of stable fluid flows

* A cellular automata simulation

* A "password recovery" tool, for dictionary lookup of MD5 hashes

'lulesh-accelerate' is an implementation of the Livermore Unstructured
Lagrangian Explicit Shock Hydrodynamics (LULESH) mini-app. LULESH represents a
typical hydrodynamics code such as ALE3D, but is highly simplified and
hard-coded to solve the Sedov blast problem on an unstructured hexahedron mesh.

and development welcome).
