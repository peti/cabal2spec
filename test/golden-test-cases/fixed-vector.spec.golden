%description
Generic library for vectors with statically known size. Implementation is based
on
<http://unlines.wordpress.com/2010/11/15/generics-for-small-fixed-size-vectors/>
Same functions could be used to work with both ADT based vector like

> data Vec3 a = a a a

Tuples are vectors too:

>>> sum (1,2,3) 6

Vectors which are represented internally by arrays are provided by library.
Both boxed and unboxed arrays are supported.

Library is structured as follows:

* Data.Vector.Fixed Generic API. It's suitable for both ADT-based vector like
Complex and array-based ones.

* Data.Vector.Fixed.Cont Continuation based vectors. Internally all functions
use them.

* Data.Vector.Fixed.Mutable Type classes for array-based implementation and API
for working with mutable state.

* Data.Vector.Fixed.Unboxed Unboxed vectors.

* Data.Vector.Fixed.Boxed Boxed vector which can hold elements of any type.

* Data.Vector.Fixed.Storable Unboxed vectors of Storable types.

* Data.Vector.Fixed.Primitive Unboxed vectors based on pritimive package.
