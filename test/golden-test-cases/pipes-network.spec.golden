%description
Use network sockets together with the 'pipes' library.

This package is organized using the following namespaces:

* "Pipes.Network.TCP" exports pipes and utilities for using TCP connections in
a streaming fashion.

* "Pipes.Network.TCP.Safe" subsumes "Pipes.Network.TCP", exporting pipes and
functions that allow you to safely establish new TCP connections within a
pipeline using the 'pipes-safe' facilities. You only need to use this module if
you want to safely acquire and release operating system resources within a
pipeline.

See the 'changelog' file in the source distribution to learn about any
important changes between version.
