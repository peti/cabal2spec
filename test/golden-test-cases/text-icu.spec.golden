%description
Haskell bindings to the International Components for Unicode (ICU) libraries.
These libraries provide robust and full-featured Unicode services on a wide
variety of platforms.

Features include:

* Both pure and impure bindings, to allow for fine control over efficiency and
ease of use.

* Breaking of strings on character, word, sentence, and line boundaries.

* Access to the Unicode Character Database (UCD) of character metadata.

* String collation functions, for locales where the conventions for
lexicographic ordering differ from the simple numeric ordering of character
codes.

* Character set conversion functions, allowing conversion between Unicode and
over 220 character encodings.

* Unicode normalization. (When implementations keep strings in a normalized
form, they can be assured that equivalent strings have a unique binary
representation.)

* Regular expression search and replace.
