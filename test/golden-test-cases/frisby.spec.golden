%description
Frisby is a parser library that can parse arbitrary PEG grammars in linear
time. Unlike other parsers of PEG grammars, frisby need not be supplied with
all possible rules up front, allowing composition of smaller parsers.

PEG parsers are never ambiguous and allow infinite lookahead with no
backtracking penalty. Since PEG parsers can look ahead arbitrarily, they can
easily express rules such as the maximal munch rule used in lexers, meaning no
separate lexer is needed.

In addition to many standard combinators, frisby provides routines to translate
standard regex syntax into frisby parsers.
