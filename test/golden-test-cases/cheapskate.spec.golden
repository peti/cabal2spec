%description
This is an experimental Markdown processor in pure Haskell. It aims to process
Markdown efficiently and in the most forgiving possible way. It is designed to
deal with any input, including garbage, with linear performance.
Output is sanitized by default for protection against XSS attacks.

Several markdown extensions are implemented, including fenced code blocks,
significant list start numbers, and autolinked URLs. See README.markdown for
details.
