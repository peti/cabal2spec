%description
Speedy slice sampling.

This implementation of the slice sampling algorithm uses 'lens' as a means to
operate over generic indexed traversable functors, so you can expect it to work
if your target function takes a list, vector, map, sequence, etc. as its
argument.

Additionally you can sample over anything that's an instance of both 'Num' and
'Variate', which is useful in the case of discrete parameters.

Exports a 'mcmc' function that prints a trace to stdout, a 'chain' function for
collecting results in memory, and a 'slice' transition operator that can be
used more generally.
