%description
This library implements the SHA suite of message digest functions, according to
NIST FIPS 180-2 (with the SHA-224 addendum), as well as the SHA-based HMAC
routines. The functions have been tested against most of the NIST and RFC test
vectors for the various functions. While some attention has been paid to
performance, these do not presently reach the speed of well-tuned libraries,
like OpenSSL.
