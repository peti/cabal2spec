%description
HaRP, or Haskell Regular Patterns, is a Haskell extension that extends the
normal pattern matching facility with the power of regular expressions.
This expressive power is highly useful in a wide range of areas, including text
parsing and XML processing. Regular expression patterns in HaRP work over
ordinary Haskell lists ([]) of arbitrary type. We have implemented HaRP as a
pre-processor to ordinary Haskell.

For details on usage, please see the website.
