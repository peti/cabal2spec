%description
Reactive-banana is a library for Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).

FRP offers an elegant and concise way to express interactive programs such as
graphical user interfaces, animations, computer music or robot controllers.
It promises to avoid the spaghetti code that is all too common in traditional
approaches to GUI programming.

See the project homepage <http://wiki.haskell.org/Reactive-banana> for more
detailed documentation and examples.

/Stability forecast./ This is a stable library, though minor API changes are
still likely. It features an efficient, push-driven implementation and has seen
some optimization work.

/API guide./ Start with the "Reactive.Banana" module.
