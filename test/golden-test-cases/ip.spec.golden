%description
The `ip` package provides types and functions for dealing with IPv4 addresses,
CIDR blocks, and MAC addresses. We provide instances for typeclasses found in
commonly used packages like `aeson`, `vector`, and `hashable`. We also provide
`Parser`s for working with attoparsec.

Notably, this package does not overload functions by introducing any
typeclasses of its own. Neither does it prefix functions with the name of the
type that they work on. Instead, functions of the same name are exported by
several different modules, and it is expected that end users disambiguate by
importing these modules qualified.

The only module intended to be imported unqualified is `Net.Types`.
The types in this package should not conflict with the types in any other
commonly used packages.

The following packages are intended to be used with this package:

* `yesod-ip`: Provides orphan instances needed to work with yesod and
persistent. Also, provides a `yesod-form` helper.
