%description
LMDB is a read-optimized Berkeley DB replacement developed by Symas for the
OpenLDAP project. LMDB has impressive performance characteristics and a
friendly BSD-style OpenLDAP license. See <http://symas.com/mdb/>.

This library has Haskell bindings to the LMDB library. You must install the
lmdb development files before installing this library, e.g. `sudo apt-get
install liblmdb-dev` works for Ubuntu 14.04.

For now, only a low level interface is provided, and the author is moving on to
use LMDB rather than further develop its bindings. If a higher level API is
desired, please consider contributing, or develop a separate package.
